# Welcome to my GitHub account

👋 Hi! I'm Mustafa Uğur Baskın, a 21-year-old Full Stack Developer and Physics undergraduate based in Turkey. I am proud to be among the <b>first Turkish undergraduates</b> to publish in an <b>international SCIE-indexed journal</b> in Physics while still pursuing my bachelor's degree. 

### 👨‍🏫 Experience

- **Sakarya University**:  
  As an intern, I developed an **AI model to predict the Mass Attenuation Coefficient (MAC)** values of glass samples for radiation applications. My key contributions included:
  
  - Developing artificial neural networks to significantly reduce processing power and waiting times for MAC predictions.
  - Co-authoring an **SCIE-indexed academic paper**, titled *“Predicting the Mass Attenuation Coefficient of Glass Systems Using a Machine Learning Approach for Radiation Applications”*, published in the *Journal of Radiation Research and Applied Sciences* in June 2024.
  - Leading the development of the AI program, conducting technical and data analysis for the study.
  - Organizing and preparing datasets for additional papers in the field of radiation physics.

### 👨‍💻 My Projects

- <b>CoSearch</b>:
Developed Python-based software that enables businesses to identify potential customer leads 30x faster than manual methods. Built a complete ecosystem accessible via both a web platform and standalone software, integrating multiple programming languages and technologies. See it [here](https://github.com/mustafaugurbaskin/CoSearch).

- <b>RNet</b>:
Created an AI-powered autonomous driving system capable of detecting road lane markings from images, videos, or real-time feeds. Trained the AI model using PyTorch on a dataset of over 200,000 images, focusing on accuracy and real-time performance. See it [here](https://github.com/mustafaugurbaskin/RNet).

- <b>SiteSurf</b>:
Designed and developed custom and template-based websites tailored to various client requirements. Delivered responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly web applications using modern web technologies.
